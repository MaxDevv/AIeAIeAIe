Inspiration
-----------

We both wanted to implement an idea that was both fun, multiplayer, and used Artificial Intelligence. We came up with the idea of a multiplayer interactive challenge where you are pitted against an AI.

What it does
------------

Users can create a party and invite their friends to solve AI generated situations with random items in their household. Users will then present their ideas to the AI, which will then be evaluated and responded with a creative and funny outcome and a new, challenging scenario.

How we built it
---------------

*   We used Svelte for the front-end creation
    
*   We used WebRTC, Socket.IO, and PeerJS for client-server communication
    
*   We used OpenRouter & Google Gemini for the video processing and creative situation generation.
    
*   We used GitHub for version control
    

Challenges we ran into
----------------------

*   It was difficult to ize peers with video/audio streaming.
    
*   We struggled with tuning the AI to balance its outcomes.
    

Accomplishments that we're proud of
-----------------------------------

We are proud of creating an entire game with complex technologies to create a fun adventure for users. The AI's stories and situations ended up being rather funny and entertaining, and the overall game was very engaging.

What we learned
---------------

*   How to use Socket.IO and integrate peer video streaming
    
*   How to use the Svelte Javascript framework
    
*   How to use WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication
    
*   How to use the Gemini completion API for video processing and text generation
    

What's next for AIeAIeAIe
-------------------------

*   Cleaning up UI and making it more refined
    
*   Adding sound effects and speech to text with a robotic voice to make it more fun
    
*   Connecting it to discord allowing friends to have chats whilst
    
*   Publicly hosting the game
    
*   Getting lots of user feedback from different players so we can improve the game
    
    *   Growing the game by encouraging users to share it with friends
